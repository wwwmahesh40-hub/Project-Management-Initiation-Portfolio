# Project Initiation Showcase: "GreenLeaf Tech Hub" Launch
## Verified Certification: Project Initiation (Google/Coursera)

This repository demonstrates the practical application of the skills I mastered during my Project Management Certification. It focuses on the **Initiation Phase**, which is critical for setting the foundation of a project's success.

### 🎯 Project Overview
The "GreenLeaf Tech Hub" project involves setting up a new sustainable co-working space over a 6-month period. 

### 🛠️ Skills & Knowledge Applied
Based on my certification training, I implemented the following:
* **Project Charter Creation**: Established goals and scope to ensure stakeholder alignment.
* **Stakeholder Management**: Identified the **Project Sponsor** as the key authority for stage-gate approvals.
* **Strategic Tool Selection**: Evaluated software based on project scope (using sophisticated tools for a large 6-month project).
* **Resource Identification**: Categorized the necessary project resources (physical and digital assets) required for completion.
