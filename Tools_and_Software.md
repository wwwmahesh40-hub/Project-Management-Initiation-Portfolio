# Tool Evaluation & Selection Matrix

For a project of this size (6 months, 100+ tasks), I selected tools based on their specific capabilities.

| Tool Type | Tool Selected | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Work Management** | **Asana** | To effectively assign tasks to a large team and track weekly progress metrics. |
| **Collaboration** | **Slack** | For efficient real-time communication across the company. |
| **Productivity** | **Google Docs** | To create meeting agendas, outline scope, and review team processes. |
| **Budget/Data** | **Spreadsheets** | To manage budgets, create timelines, and build financial charts. |

**Strategy**: Since this is a large-scope project, I opted for **more sophisticated tools** (Asana) over simple checklists to ensure efficiency.
